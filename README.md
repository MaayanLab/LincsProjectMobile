# Mobile Application for LINCS Project Mobile

## Getting Started

This is a mobile app that runs on a mobile simulator. XCode has its own simulator for iOS whereas Android has many different ones and requires a little more configuration.

To run locally:
iOS -
1) Ensure XCode is installed.
2) Run `npm install`
3) Run `react-native run-ios`

Android -
1) Ensure an Android Emulator is installed. I recommend GenyMotion (You can create a free account).
2) Follow instructions [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/releases/0.23/docs/android-setup.html)
3) Run `react-native run-android`

## Learning the Codebase
There are a number of technologies you need to learn in order to manage this website. We **strongly** recommend you go through the React and MobX tutorials before proceeding any further. Some cursory knowledge of [ECMAScript 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) is useful for mentally parsing the code, but you can probably pick this up along the way.

### Client side

- ECMAScript 6
  - The code is written in ES6, but we use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to compile it ES5 for cross-browser support.
  - [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read)
  - [ES6 equivalents in ES6](https://github.com/addyosmani/es6-equivalents-in-es5)
- React Native
  - React/React Native are JavaScript libraries for modularizing user interfaces into easy-to-manage components. Each component is a combination of JavaScript and HTML, which makes it easy to see the data, behavior, and view all in a single file. React handles rendering the component through the lifecycle of the application.
  - [Facebook's React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) is a good place to start.
- MobX
  - MobX is a JavaScript library for making the state of an application easier to reason about. Using MobX, the state of an application is represented by a "store". Each time part of the application changes, MobX recomputes the store and React rerenders the application.

### Server side
  - Node

### Deployment:
iOS -
Once your version of app is ready for deployment (after testing including on physical device)
, we will launch the app in the App Store. This will require the lab iTunes Connect account
(speak with Avi or Sherry for this). We will deploy this app using XCode.

Please read the top answer for this StackOverflow [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34933439/how-to-build-react-native-ios-app-get-an-app-file-and-deploy-to-device).

Android -
We will generate an .apk file and upload it to the Play Store.
Generating .apk for Android

1) Be sure to update version in build.gradle
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35924721/how-to-update-version-number-of-react-native-app
2) Update gradle.properties passwords but do not commit them.
pass hint: modified-lowercase-sysbio
3) cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html
4) Uninstall any previous versions of this app from Android emulator
5) Test with: react-native run-android --variant=release

*Note* We tried using CodePush (enables most deployments without having to attain
Apple/Google's approval each time), but it is buggy at the moment and not working
properly. So I've disabled it for now. Perhaps once it reaches a more stable
stage, we can reimplement it.
